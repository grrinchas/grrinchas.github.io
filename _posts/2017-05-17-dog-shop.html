<p>
    Web application written using JavaEE and JavaFX technologies. There is three parts of it: <i>database</i>,
    <i>server</i> and <i>clients</i>. It works similarly to {{ URL[32] }} shopping system.
    Using a <code class="d-code">customer terminal</code> customer searches for an item. Later he presents chosen item's
    ID and the quantity to the cashier. Using <code class="d-code">cashier terminal</code> cashier checks if
    an item is present in the warehouse and orders to pick it up. Customer on the <code class="d-code">screen terminal</code>
    sees his order status. Meanwhile warehouse worker picks the item and updates the stock using its own
    <code class="d-code">picker terminal</code>.
    API.
</p>

{{ IMG[12] }}

<p>
    {{ IMG_URL[12] }} shows <code class="d-code">cashier terminal</code> after she clicked to order customer's items.
    Project files can be found on the following GitHub repositories: {{ URL[33] }} and {{ URL[34] }}.

<h2><a name="{{ page.headers[0].id }}"></a>{{ page.headers[0].name }}</h2>

<p>
    Writing distributed web application is not an easy task, especially if you do not have any experience.
    That's way DogShop was even bigger challenge than a {{ POST_URL[5] }}.
    Nevertheless, I managed to complete it in a reasonable time and learnt lots of new things. For example,
    I gained better understanding about software's three tier architecture and how different components
    fit together, that is database, server and the clients. Learnt about {{ URL[35] }} mainly its three major components:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>{{ URL[36] }} - for business logic.</li>
    <li>{{ URL[37] }} - for persistence.</li>
    <li>{{ URL[38] }} - for presentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    In addition, {{ URL[39] }}, {{ URL[40] }} web services and {{ URL[41] }} are not a foreign terms anymore.
</p>

<h2><a name="{{ page.headers[1].id }}"></a>{{ page.headers[1].name }}</h2>

<p>
Many things. DogShop is far away from being in production. First of all, it doesn't
have code for dealing with exceptions. Second, testing has to be more throughout,
at the moment only basic functionality has been tested. Third, code especially on client's side has to be refactored
    and documentation added. Lastly, RESTful API needs improvement as well.
