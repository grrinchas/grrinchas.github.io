    Break out clone written in {{ URL[6] }} using {{ URL[7] }} (ECS) pattern. This was a coursework for
    programming module and my first big project. The end result and the source code can be found on the
    {{ URL[8] }}. Just <code class="d-code">clone</code> or <code class="d-code">fork</code> to get a copy,
    then build and run with {{ URL[9] }}

When I started this project I knew only basics: java syntax, conditional statements, loops, methods
and little bit about inheritance. But I had to start somewhere and came across with
{{ URL[10] }} book. Which gave me pretty good insight to JavaFX. How to setup game loop, timers, asset management etc. Unfortunately,
I was not impressed by the end result. Had few classes with hundredths of lines. My lack of understanding about
{{ URL[11] }} forced me to read {{ URL[12] }}book.

I redesigned the project from ground up and ended up with more than 15 classes and interfaces.
Which was good, had working game and code looked pretty clean. But then I started to think what if I want to extend it,
for example, add different power ups or make bricks (tomatoes in my case) to move. This will be very hard to accomplish,
because I will have to extend my classes deeply  and will end up with tight coupling. Lucky for me someone introduced
me with {{ URL[107] }} pattern which is very popular in game development.
After redesigning again, and by redesigning I mean copying all the project files to new folder,
then modifying them, I realized that this is too laborious and has to be better solution to control all the versions.
And this is where I realized importance of {{ URL[13] }}. Of course to learn about it, had to read {{ URL[14] }}.

    or run <code class="d-code">git clone https://github.com/grrinchas/squash</code> from your favorite command line tool.
