<p>
Simple blog type website created from scratch using only <code class="d-code">HTML5</code>and
<code class="d-code">CSS3</code>. It is responsive and has three pages:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>{{ URL[15] }} - contains post entries. </li>
    <li>{{ URL[16] }} - for entering contact information. </li>
    <li>{{ URL[17] }} - shows most popular hotels and restaurants in Eastbourne. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="{{ page.headers[0].id }}"></a>{{ page.headers[0].name }}</h2>

<p>
    It is impossible to create a website if you know nothing about what a <code class="d-code">tag</code> or an
    <code class="d-code">attribute</code> means. The best introductory book which I found was {{ URL[18] }}.
    I really encourage to read this one to everyone who just started creating websites.
    Another good resource was {{ URL[19] }} which explained about <code class="d-code">RWD</code>.
    And {{ URL[20] }} website helped me understand semantic meaning between different <code class="d-code">HTML5</code> elements.
</p>

<p>
    Equipped with this power knowledge I manage to make first web page.
    Unfortunately, I was not satisfied with the results,
    because it looked <i>off</i>. Did little bit research and found that the missing piece was a lack of
    <i>design principles</i>. Bad font choice, loads of colours created visually repulsive look.
    {{ URL[21] }} and  {{ URL[22] }} improved that considerably.

</p>
<p>
    Later on I finished project with a {{ URL[17] }} which used entirely different stylesheet.

    Fully working project can be found via {{ URL[23] }}.
