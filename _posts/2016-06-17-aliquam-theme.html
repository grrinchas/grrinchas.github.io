{{ IMG[11] }}

<p>
    Minimalistic, blog-aware {{ URL[24] }} theme. It can be used to host your blog on {{ URL[13] }} for free.
    Just fork it from {{ URL[25] }}, change <code class="d-code">aliquam</code> repository name to
    <code class="d-code">yourGithubName.github.io</code> and access it through
    <code class="d-code">https://yourName.github.io</code>.
</p>

<h2><a name="{{ page.headers[0].id }}"></a>{{ page.headers[0].name }}</h2>

<p>
To make a blog, you do not need to have deep knowledge about <code class="d-code">HTML</code> or
    <code class="d-code">CSS</code>. Just create account with {{ URL[26] }} or  {{ URL[27] }}.
    Choose from thousandths of templates and start to blog. But this simplicity comes with a price.
</p>
<p>
    First of all it is hard to find a template which would fit your requirements 100%.
    Second, you get thousandths lines of code with features which in most cases are unnecessary.
    On the other hand, if you would like to add a feature you have to install plugins,
    which are not optimized and slows down your website. Third, if you want to change something manually,
    you will spend hours on breaking and fixing. In the end I realized that using this kind of
    <code class="d-code">CMS</code> is not an option for me.
</p>
<p>
    GitHub provides full support for static <code class="d-code">CMS</code> - {{ URL[24] }}
    which is easy to learn, supports  {{ URL[28] }} template engine for organizing <code class="d-code">HTML</code> files,
    {{ URL[29] }} for organizing <code class="d-code">CSS</code>, {{ URL[30] }} for writhing posts and
    {{ URL[31] }} syntax highlighter.
