---

![Learning Journal Main Page](/resources/images/learning-journal.jpg)

Simple blog type website created from scratch using only <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> and
<abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS3</abbr>. It is responsive and has three pages:

1. [Main page](http://grrinchas.github.io/learning-journal/index.html) - contains post entries.
2. [Contact form](http://grrinchas.github.io/learning-journal/contact_me.html) - for entering contact information.
3. [A guide page](http://grrinchas.github.io/learning-journal/guide.html) - shows most popular hotels and restaurants in Eastbourne.


##Task

To build a static blog type website.

##Requirements

- Has to have three pages(main, contact and guide).
- Only use <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS3</abbr> and <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML5</abbr>.
- Document all the progress.
- Do not use any pre made template (Wordpress etc.).
- Do not use any JavaScript.

##Reflection

It is impossible to create a website if you know nothing about what a `tag` or an `attribute` are. The
best introductory book which I found was <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1118008189/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1118008189&linkCode=as2&tag=dennisgrinch-21">HTML & CSS: Design and Build Web Sites</a>. I really encourage to read this one to everyone who
just started creating websites.

Another good resource was <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/144936294X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=144936294X&linkCode=as2&tag=dennisgrinch-21">Learning Responsive Web Design: A Beginner's Guide</a> which explained about <abbr title="Responsive Web Design">RWD</abbr>. And [HTML Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/) website helped me understand semantic meaning
between different <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML5</abbr> elements.


Equipped with this power knowledge I manage to make first web page. Unfortunately I was not satisfied with the results,
because it looked _"off"_. Did little bit research and found that the missing piece was a lack of _design principles_.
Bad font choice, loads of colours created visually repulsive look. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1598390775/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1598390775&linkCode=as2&tag=dennisgrinch-21">Typography for Lawyers</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321767535/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0321767535&linkCode=as2&tag=dennisgrinch-21">100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People: What Makes Them Tick?</a>
improved that considerably.

Later on I finished project with a [guide page](http://grrinchas.github.io/learning-journal/guide.html) which used entirely different <abbr title="Cascade Style Sheet">CSS3</abbr> stylesheet.

##Conclusion

In the end I accomplished a task by 100%. Fully working project can be found via [Learning Journal](http://grrinchas.github.io/learning-journal/).
