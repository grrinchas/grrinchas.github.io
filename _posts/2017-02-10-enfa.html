    In previous tutorials we talked about <a href="{{ POST101.url }}">{{ POST101.title }}</a> and
     <a href="{{ POST102.url }}">{{ POST102.title }}</a>. Here we will focus on <strong>ε-NFA
     (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton)</strong> which may or may not have ε(read as "epsilon")-transitions.
</p>

<h2><a name="{{ page.headers[0].id }}"></a>{{ page.headers[0].name }}</h2>

<p>
    As you may guessed, the main difference between NFA and ε-NFA is ε-transitions. That is, ε-NFA may have one or more of
    them. I say <i>may have</i> because some ε-NFA don't have, in that case we will call it simply NFA.
    Thus, NFA can be seen as a special kind of ε-NFA without ε-transitions.

<p>
    We have already encountered something similar. In {{ POST100_LINK_DEF102 }} I
    mentioned <strong>Kleene closure $$Σ^*$$ </strong>, which denotes all the strings over alphabet $$Σ$$.
    One element of $$Σ^*$$ is an empty string, denoted by $$ε$$. It was used in the base case of $$δ^∗$$
    function $$δ^∗(q, ε) = q$$ to indicate the end of the string.
</p>

<p>
    Similarly, ε-transition means a state's transition to the next state when input symbol is an empty string. In other words,
    a transition when there are no input symbol at all.
    {{ LINK_IMG106 }} shows a state diagram of ε-NFA which recognises language of $$(ab ∪ a)^*$$.

</figure>

<div class="success alert">
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> In {{ LINK_IMG106 }} the start state $$q_0$$ is also an accept state.
</div>

<p>We can see bunch of ε-transitions: from $$q_0$$ to $$q_1$$, then from $$q_1$$ to both $$q_2$$ and $$q_6$$ and so on.
    <i>How should we interpret all those transitions?</i> Let's say automaton's current state is $$q_0$$, then without
    any input it transitions to $$q_1$$, from there to $$q_2$$ and $$q_6$$. So actually, at the beginning of computation
    automaton is in 4 states. Or we can think of it as 4 parallel machines computing simultaneously. {{ LINK_IMG107 }}
    shows a computation tree for <code class="d-code">ab</code> string.
</p>

<figure>
    {% for member in site.data.images %}
        {% if member.id == page.images[1] %}
            {% assign img = member %}
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    <a name="{{ img.id }}"></a>

    <figcaption>
        <strong>Image {{ img.id | remove: "IMG" | split: "" | join: "." }}:</strong> {{ img.caption }}
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    First of all, computation begins at the start state $$q_0$$ (root node). Notice, $$q_0$$ has ε-transition to $$q_1$$, thus
    we create new branch node with a leaf of $$q_1$$. From $$q_1$$ there are two more transitions: one to $$q_2$$, another to $$q_6$$,
    therefore we create two more branches. Lastly, to indicate that $$q_0$$ is included in a set of current states,
    we make a branch for it as well.
</p>

<div class="note alert">
    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> When discussing about a set of all possible ε-transitions from the state, it's convenient to think
    that there is an extra ε-transition from state to itself, even state diagrams don't show it.
</div>

<p>So, the second level of the tree shows all current states of the machine. This is interesting, because we haven't even
    input any symbol and yet ε-NFA is already in 4 states. What is more interesting, that one of those states $$q_0$$ is an
    accept state. Therefore, if we would give an empty string, it would accept it. Anyway, let's look at first input symbol
    <code class="d-code">a</code>. There are no transition from $$q_0$$ and $$q_1$$, thus both machines die. On the other hand,
    $$q_6$$ has transition to $$q_7$$, from there are four ε-transitions to other states, itself included. Also, $$q_2$$
    has transition to $$q_3$$. From there are two ε-transitions: one to itself and another to $$q_4$$.
</p>

<p>For next symbol <code class="d-code">b</code>, there is only one transition: from $$q_4$$ to $$q_5$$. Therefore,
all other machines die. From $$q_5$$ are four ε-transitions: to $$q_5$$, $$q_1$$, $$q_2$$, $$q_6$$. One of those
transitions leads to $$q_5$$ state, which is an accept state. Thus, ε-NFA accepts string <code class="d-code">ab</code>.

    The main difference between {{ POST102_LINK_DEF106 }} and {{ LINK_DEF109 }} is the domain of transition function $$δ$$,
    more particularly - an alphabet $$Σ$$. Former doesn't include an empty string $$ε$$, while latter does.

    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> An empty string $$ε$$ is not part of automaton's alphabet $$Σ$$.

<p>
    Usually, after formally defining automaton we give definition of extended transition function $$δ^*$$ following
    of acceptance of strings. Unfortunately, ε-NFA has ε-transitions which complicate things. Thus, before we can talk
    about $$δ^*$$ function, we have to define <strong>ε-closure</strong>. Informally, we <i>ε-close</i> a state $$q$$ by
    following all the transitions which are labeled ε. When we get to other states, then we follow ε-transitions out of
    those states, and so on, eventually finding every state that can be reach from $$q$$ along any path whose arrows
    are labeled ε. More formally,
</p>


{% for def in site.definitions %}
    {% if def.identity == page.definitions[2] %}
        <a name="{{ def.identity }}"></a>
        <div class="env-header">
            Definition {{ def.identity | remove: "DEF"  | split: "" | join: "." }}

<p>
    At first glance {{ LINK_DEF111 }} is not very intuitive. So, let's tackle this together. We take any set $$S$$ which
    is a subset of $$Q$$. Meaning, $$S$$ represents some states from all the states in the machine $$M$$.
    In addition, we are defining $$E(S)$$ in terms of set of states, rather just one state.
    <i>So, if I would want to implement ε-closure as a method, I would need to pass set of states to it, rather
    just one state.</i>Then, the base case $$S ⊆ E(S)$$ tells us that a set $$S$$ is a subset of $$F(S)$$.
    <i>But how does it help us?</i> We still don't know what elements $$E(S)$$ has in the first place. In fact,
    we are defining $$E(S)$$ in this very moment. But we do know definition of the <strong>subset</strong>
</p>

{% for def in site.definitions %}
    {% if def.identity == page.definitions[3] %}
        <a name="{{ def.identity }}"></a>
        <div class="env-header">
            Definition {{ def.identity | remove: "DEF"  | split: "" | join: "." }}
        </div>
        <div class="definition alert">
            {{ def.content }}
        </div>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

<p>
    This funny looking symbol $$\forall$$ stands for <i>"for all"</i>. So, one set is a subset of another if and only if,
    all the elements in it are elements in another. Thus, by saying that set $$S$$ is a subset of $$E(S)$$, we are saying,
    that all elements in $$S$$ is also in $$E(S)$$, otherwise our statement would be false.
    And that makes sense. Because, when we where considering ε-transitions, we said that a state itself is always included
    in the resulting set.
</p>

<p class="bottomless">
    If the base case in {{ LINK_DEF111 }} includes current states in $$F(S)$$, then the second part includes all the states which
    can be reached following ε-transitions. Let's look at specific example of $$E(S)$$ when $$S=\{q_0\}$$,
</p>

$$$\begin{align}
S = \{q_0\} \subseteq E(S) &\implies q_0 \in E(S) \\
δ(q_0, ε) = \{q_1\} ⊆ E(S) &\implies q_1 \in E(S)\\
δ(q_1, ε) = \{q_2, q_6\} ⊆ E(S) &\implies q_2,q_6 \in E(S) \\
δ(q_2, ε) = \emptyset ⊆ E(S) \\
δ(q_6, ε) = \emptyset ⊆ E(S) \\
\end{align}
$$$

<p>
    Thus, if $$S = \{q_0\}$$, then $$F(S) = \{q_0, q_1, q_2, q_6\}$$. Notice, there are no ε-transitions from $$q_2$$
    or $$q_6$$, therefore $$δ(q_2 \text{ or } q_6, ε) = \emptyset$$. Empty set has no elements, therefore it has no
    implication in this case. Recursive part of {{ LINK_DEF111 }} is considered finished, when all
    the elements (states) in $$F(S)$$ has been checked for ε-transitions.
</p>

<p>
    Now, we are ready to define extended transition function.
</p>

{% for def in site.definitions %}
    {% if def.identity == page.definitions[1] %}
        <a name="{{ def.identity }}"></a>
        <div class="env-header">
            Definition {{ def.identity | remove: "DEF"  | split: "" | join: "." }}
        </div>
        <div class="definition alert">
            {{ def.content }}
        </div>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

<p>
    The main difference between NFA's {{ POST102_LINK_DEF107 }} of $$δ^*$$ and {{ LINK_DEF110 }} is ε-closure inclusion in
    the latter. For example, the base case changed from $$δ^∗(q, ε) = \{q\}$$ to $$δ^∗(q, ε) = E(\{q\})$$. This has an
    effect of including all the ε-transitions of set of states at the end of input string. Similarly, in recursive case
    at each pass, $$δ^*$$ returns not just set of states given a symbol, but all the states which can be reached following
    ε-transitions as well.
