![Aliquam - Jekyll Theme](/resources/images/aliquam.jpg)

Minimalistic, blog-aware [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme. It can be used to host your blog on [GitHub](https://github.com/) for free. Just [fork it](https://github.com/grrinchas/aliquam), change `aliquam` repository name to `yourGithubName.github.io` and access it through `https://yourGithubName.github.io` link. Also you can always clone it `git clone https://github.com/grrinchas/aliquam`. Live preview can be found [here](http://grrinchas.github.io/aliquam).

##Features

- [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comment system
- Google analytics
- Pagination support
- Custom tags and categories
- <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> support
- Contact form integration


##Task

Was to create a blog, where I could show my portfolio and post some useful information from time to time.

##Requirements

- Has to be fully customizable and maintainable.
- Has to be minimalistic.
- Has to have all the features listed above.
- Has to be hosted on GitHub.

##Reflection

To make a blog, you do not need to have deep knowledge about <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> or <abbr title="cascade style sheet">CSS</abbr>. Just create account with [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) or [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com). Choose from thousandths of templates and start to blog. But this simplicity comes with a price.

First of all it is hard to find a template which would fit your requirements 100%. Second, you get thousandths lines of code with features which in most cases are unnecessary. On the other hand, if you would like to add a feature you have to install plugins, which are not optimized and slows down your website. Third, if you want to change something manually, you will spend hours on breaking and fixing. In the end I realized that using this kind of <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> is not an option for me.

GitHub provides full support for static <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr> - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is easy to learn, supports [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) template engine for organizing <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> files, [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for organizing <abbr title="cascade style sheet">CSS</abbr>, [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for writhing posts and [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/) syntax highlighter.

After creating a blog, thought would be nice to share its template. Which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/grrinchas/aliquam).
