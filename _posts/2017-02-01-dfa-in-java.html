    In this tutorial I will show you how to implement any deterministic finite automaton (DFA) in Java.
    Before we start, would be good thing to refresh our knowledge about them
    (see {{ POST_URL[0] }}).

<p>For implementation, I will use DFA given in {{ POST100_LINK_IMG100 }}.
While state diagrams are fun to look at, they are not as useful as {{ POST100_LINK_DEF100 }}. It will be much
    easier for us to implement DFA looking at it as 5-tuple rather using state diagram. Thus, DFA given in
     {{ POST100_LINK_IMG100 }} is described as
</p>

<p>
    $$M = (Q, Σ, δ, q_0, F )$$, where
</p>

<ol>
    <li>$$Q = \{q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4\}$$,</li>
    <li>$$Σ = \{$$<code class="d-code">:</code>$$,$$<code class="d-code">)</code>$$,$$<code
                class="d-code">(</code>$$,$$<code class="d-code">_</code>$$\}$$
    </li>
    <li>$$q_0 = q_0$$,</li>
    <li>$$F = \{q_2, q_3\}$$.</li>
    <li>$$δ$$ is described as a <strong>transition table</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>
Given all this information, we can start coding. We see that automaton
has 4states: $$q_0$$, $$q_1$$, $$q_2$$, $$q_3$$, $$q_4$$. All of them are known in advance. Thus, we can create
<code class="d-code"> private enum States {...}</code>
to represent them. Nice thing about Java enum, is that you can define methods and instance variables in them. For example,
to differentiate accept and non accept states, we can introduce instance variable
<code class="d-code">final boolean accept;</code>  for each state.
</p>

{{ SC[0] }}


Nothing fancy going on in {{ SC_URL[0] }}. Line 1 declares enum. Notice, because it will be inside of
another class, enum has <code class="d-code">private</code> access modifier. Line 3 creates all four states and represents $$Q$$ from definition. $$F$$ is
represented as an instance variable inside enum. We could create set consisting of all accept states as per definition. But
remember, Java is object oriented, thus better treat states as objects, rather as data structures, in this case <i>sets</i>.
Lastly, on Line 9 we are passing <code class="d-code">boolean</code> value to the constructor. Line 13 indicates that this
class is not finished.


<h2><a name="{{ page.headers[2].id }}"></a>{{ page.headers[2].name }}</h2>

<p>
Just like that, we defined automaton's states $$Q$$ and a subset of accepting states $$F$$. Now, let's think how to implement
transitions. Probably your first thought is: <i>we can use two dimensional array or a map or a hashtable</i>. All these
solutions are good, and they would work. Unfortunately they are not very object oriented. Think of a state as being
an object, to which you can send some messages for enquiry or making them to do something for you. For example, we can
ask it if it is an accept state or not? By introducing a method
    <code class="d-code">boolean isAccept() {...}</code> which would return it's
instance variable <code class="d-code">accept</code>. But in our case, it is not necessary, because
    <code class="d-code"> private enum States {...}</code> will be a member of
    <code class="d-code">public class DFA {...}</code>, thus all its variables will be accessible to outer class.
</p>

<p>
Similarly, given a character from the alphabet, we can ask a state to transit to another. So, instead of writing
    transition table and then passing it to some kind of function, we will define method
    <code class="d-code">States transition(char ch) {...}</code> inside
    <code class="d-code">private enum States {...}</code> to get next state. For that we will have to introduce additional instance variables in the enum.
Each variable will contain a reference to the state. I think, to show is much easier than to explain.
</p>

{{ SC[1] }}

<p>
First few lines are nothing new. On the Line 5, like I said, we are introducing some instance variables. There are four
symbols in the alphabet, thus each state will have four transitions. For example
    <code class="d-code">States eyes;</code> represents a state, to which
current state would transit if input symbol would be <code class="d-code">:</code>.
 </p>

<p>
Given these extra variables, we need to assign values to them. We do this in
    <code class="d-code">static {...}</code> block. You may ask <i>Why can't we pass
        values as arguments to the constructor</i>, like we did for <code class="d-code">final boolean accept;</code> variable. For two reasons:
</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Forward referencing</strong>. When we are trying to assign a state to the variable, some of the states are not have been
initialised. For example, to assign
<code class="d-code">Q1</code> to <code class="d-code">eyes</code> in <code class="d-code">Q0</code>
we need reference of <code class="d-code">Q1</code>, but it is not initialised yet, so we get an error.</li>
<li><strong>Circular referencing</strong>. It is similar to forward referencing. We are trying to pass non existing state to the constructor.
The difference is, that constructor belongs to the state itself. For example, passing
<code class="d-code">Q4</code> to <code class="d-code">Q4</code> constructor.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    On the other hand, in <code class="d-code">static {...}</code> block all the states are initialised and available to use.
    For convenience I arranged assignments of variables, so that
they would resemble transition table. Also, lets not forget about
    <code class="d-code">States transition(char ch) {...}</code> method which checks what kind of
character is passed, and based on that returns next state. We could have transition function in
    <code class="d-code"> public class DFA {...}</code> class, it would
make no difference.
 </p>

<h2><a name="{{ page.headers[5].id }}"></a>{{ page.headers[5].name }}</h2>

At this moment you should notice one thing: transition method
<code class="d-code">States transition(char ch) {...}</code> breaks definition of {{ LINK_H0 }}.

<p>
Because it accepts more than four symbols of our alphabet. In fact, it accepts any $$Unicode$$ character.
Therefore, $$Σ = \{$$<code class="d-code">:</code>$$,$$<code class="d-code">)</code>$$,$$<code
        class="d-code">(</code>$$,$$<code class="d-code">_</code>$$\} \neq Unicode $$. There are few ways how to fix it:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>By encapsulating alphabet.</li>
    <li>By changing DFA itself.</li>
</ul>

<h3>By encapsulating alphabet</h3>

<p>
To enforce $$Σ = \{$$<code class="d-code">:</code>$$,$$<code class="d-code">)</code>$$,$$<code
        class="d-code">(</code>$$,$$<code class="d-code">_</code>$$\}$$ we could encapsulate alphabet. By creating
    <code class="d-code">private enum Alphabet {...}</code> and changing transition signature to
    <code class="d-code">States transition(Alphabet symbol) {...}</code>.
</p>

{{ SC[2] }}

<p>
Now, would be impossible to pass non exciting character to the transition method. While this approach would solve our problem,
it would create new one: <i>what to do with other $$Unicode$$ characters which are not in the alphabet?</i> In the original
    {{ SC_URL[1] }} we threw an exception in the transition method. Now we could to the same, only outside DFA. Or change
    strings to <code class="d-code">List&lt;Alphabet&gt;</code>. The first approach would solve no problem, while latter
    would be impractical, unless DFA would be confined in Java program and wouldn't interact with outside word.
</p>

<h3>By changing DFA itself</h3>

<p>
The main problem is an alphabet $$Σ$$. We want to change it from $$\{$$<code class="d-code">:</code>$$,$$<code class="d-code">)</code>$$,$$<code
        class="d-code">(</code>$$,$$<code class="d-code">_</code>$$\}$$ to $$Unicode$$. {{ IMG_URL[2] }} shows a state
    diagram of a new DFA.
</p>

{{ IMG[2] }}

<p>
Notice, we removed all symbols from the arrows pointing to the state $$q_4$$. An empty arrow stands for
a transition from a state $$q_i$$, where $$i ∈ \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$$, to $$q_4$$ if and only if there are no transition from
$$q_i$$ to $$q_i$$, given a symbol from the $$Unicode$$. For example, if current state is $$q_0$$ then given
<code class="d-code">:</code> DFA transitions to $$q_1$$, while given <code class="d-code">^</code> to $$q_4$$.
    {{ SC_URL[3] }} shows new implementation of <code class="d-code">private enum States {...} </code>.

</p>

{{ SC[3] }}

<p>
So, we removed some of the assignments of states instance variables and changed transition method. Now, before returning
next state it checks if instance variable is <code class="d-code">null</code> or not. In case of <code class="d-code">null</code>
and by default it returns <code class="d-code">Q4</code> state.
</p>

<p>
Notice, even we did not define all possible transitions of the state, this DFA implementation conforms with {{ POST100_LINK_DEF100 }},
because for every state and every symbol from the alphabet there is a state.
</p>

<p>
The only thing what left is to implement extended transition function $$δ^*$$ (see {{ POST100_LINK_DEF102 }}). We will
    do this by creating
    <code class="d-code">public boolean accept(String string) {...}</code> method
    in <code class="d-code">public class DFA {...}</code>
    which checks if automaton accepts string.
</p>

{{ SC[4] }}

<h2><a name="{{ page.headers[4].id }}"></a>{{ page.headers[4].name }}</h2>

<p>
Using enums we can implement any DFA. Unfortunately they are not very flexible. Meaning, that if we would like to introduce
additional state or extra character, then we would need to modify enum itself, which violates
{{ URL[1] }}. For that we could use {{ URL [2] }}. But if you are thinking about modification of DFA, then
probably your don't need DFA in the first place. Because by definition, DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) is
<strong>finite</strong>, meaning it has finite set of states and <strong>deterministic</strong> - its next state is determined by input symbol.
