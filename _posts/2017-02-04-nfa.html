    In previous tutorial (see <a href="{{ POST100.url }}">{{ POST100.title }}</a>) we talked about DFA and implemented
    one in JAVA (see <a href="{{ POST101.url }}">{{ POST101.title }}</a>). Here we will focus on
    <strong>NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton)</strong> or <strong>NFSM (Nondeterministic Finite State Machine)</strong>.
</p>

<div class="note alert">
    <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> In general, when someone talks about NFA, he/she means a nondeterministic finite automaton
    which may or may not have $$ε$$-transitions. While it is convenient to make no distinction between these two types
    of automaton, it makes, however, harder to understand them. Thus, I will make a clear distinction between NFA
    ($$ε$$-transitions are not allowed) and generalization of it - <strong>$$ε$$-NFA</strong> ($$ε$$-transition are allowed).
</div>

<h2><a name="{{ page.headers[0].id }}"></a>{{ page.headers[0].name }}</h2>

<p>
    Just by looking at the names of NFA and DFA, we can see the main difference between them. That is, DFA is a
    <strong>deterministic</strong> while NFA is <strong>nondeterministic</strong>. <i>But what exactly means for automaton
        to be deterministic?</i> From {{ POST100_LINK_IMG100 }} of DFA we see that given any state and any symbol there is only one
    transition to the next state. Thus, next state is determined. While NFA has no such constraint. For example,
    {{ LINK_IMG103 }} shows NFA which recognises language of $$\{aa, aab\}^*\{b\}$$.
</p>


<figure>
    {% for member in site.data.images %}
        {% if member.id == page.images[0] %}
            {% assign img = member %}
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    <a name="{{ img.id }}"></a>
    <img src="{{ img.src }}" alt="{{ img.alt }}"/>
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Image {{ img.id | remove: "IMG" | split: "" | join: "." }}:</strong> {{ img.caption }}
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    From image above we see that some states in NFA,
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Don't have transition for every symbol in the alphabet. For example, $$q_1$$ and $$q_2$$ don't
    have transition for <code class="d-code">b</code>, while $$q_3$$ - for <code class="d-code">a</code>.</li>
    <li>Can have no transitions at all. For example, $$q_4$$ doesn't have any arrow pointing out.</li>
    <li>Can have more than one transition for a given symbol. For example, if input symbol is  <code class="d-code">a</code>, then $$q_0$$ can
    transition to $$q_1$$ and $$q_2$$.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    One of the advantage of NFAs over DFAs, are their simplicity. State diagrams of NFAs tend to have less nodes and edges.
    For example {{ LINK_IMG105 }} shows equivalent DFA which recognises same
    $$\{aa, aab\}^*\{b\}$$ language.
</p>

    {% for member in site.data.images %}

<p>
    First of all, given symbol from the alphabet, NFA can transition to zero, one, or many states.
    Thus, transition function output is not just one state as in DFA, but set of states. So, if a state doesn't have
    a transition to other state for a given input, then an empty set is returned. On the other hand, if a state has one or more
    transitions, then a set with all applicable states are returned. One way of thinking about NFA, is to imagine many
    parallel computations. For example, if NFA is in the start state $$q_0$$, then input symbol $$a$$ forces it to split
    itself into two machines computing simultaneously, one of which has $$q_1$$, other one - $$q_2$$ as current state.
    NFA accepts a string if at least one of the machines ends up in the accept state.
</p>

<p>
    One way of representing NFA computation is a tree. For example, {{ LINK_IMG104 }} shows how NFA from {{ LINK_IMG103 }}
    accepts <code class="d-code">aaaab</code> string.
</p>


<figure>
    {% for member in site.data.images %}
        {% if member.id == page.images[1] %}
            {% assign img = member %}
        {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    <a name="{{ img.id }}"></a>
    <img src="{{ img.src }}" alt="{{ img.alt }}"/>
    <figcaption>
        <strong>Image {{ img.id | remove: "IMG" | split: "" | join: "." }}:</strong> {{ img.caption }}
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    First symbol of <code class="d-code">aaaab</code> is <code class="d-code">a</code>. From {{ LINK_IMG103 }} we see that,
    given symbol <code class="d-code">a</code>, start state $$q_0$$ has two transitions: one to $$q_1$$, other - to $$q_2$$.
    Both those transitions are represented as a first split in the tree. So, left and right branches stands for two parallel machines.
    When NFA receives second symbol <code class="d-code">a</code>, then actually two machines receives it. First one transitions to
    $$q_0$$, while another to $$q_3$$ state. After third input symbol, which again is <code class="d-code">a</code>,
    first machine splits into two, while second dies, because state $$q_3$$ doesn't have transition for symbol
    <code class="d-code">a</code>. After fourth symbol <code class="d-code">a</code> NFA is in two states: $$q_0$$ and
    $$q_3$$. And after the last symbol <code class="d-code">b</code> one machine transitions from $$q_0$$ to $$q_4$$, another
    - from $$q_3$$ to $$q_0$$. One of the final states $$q_4$$ is an accept state, thus NFA accepts string <code class="d-code">aaaab</code>.

<p>
    The only difference between {{ POST100_LINK_DEF100 }} of DFA and {{ LINK_DEF106 }} of NFA is a transition function $$δ$$.
    In the first case it is $$δ:Q × Σ → Q$$, while in later - $$δ:Q × Σ → P(Q)$$. In other words, DFA's transition outputs
    only one state from $$Q$$, while NFA - one set of states from $$P(Q)$$. Notation of $$P(Q)$$ denotes <strong>power set of $$Q$$</strong>.
    In other words all subsets of $$Q$$. For example, let $$Q = \{a, b, c\}$$, then

    $$$P(Q) = \{\{∅\}, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a, b\}, \{a, c\}, \{b, c\}, \{a, b, c\}\}$$$

    Notice, $$∅$$ is included in the power set. Therefore, is perfectly valid for transition function to return an empty set.
    For example (see {{ LINK_IMG103 }}), if the first argument is a state $$q_1$$ and the second is a symbol
    <code class="d-code">b</code>, then transition function $$δ$$ is $$ δ(q_1, b) = ∅$$.

<p>
For DFA we defined extended transition function in {{ POST100_LINK_DEF102 }}. The same thing we will do for NFA.
</p>

{% for def in site.definitions %}
    {% if def.identity == page.definitions[1] %}
        <a name="{{ def.identity }}"></a>
        <div class="env-header">
            Definition {{ def.identity | remove: "DEF"  | split: "" | join: "." }}
        </div>
        <div class="definition alert">
            {{ def.content }}
        </div>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

<p>
The first thing what we should notice, $$δ^*$$ is defined recursively. Note the difference between base case in
    {{ POST100_LINK_DEF102 }} and {{ LINK_DEF107 }}. Former, given a state and empty string, returns same state.
    While latter, returns set of states. And it does make sense, because at the end, NFA may end up in more than one state.
</p>

<p>
    While the base case of $$δ^*$$ for NFA looks almost the same as for DFA, recursive case doesn't. The most notable
    difference is an operation over set of sets $$\bigcup$$ called <strong>infinitary union</strong>. For example,
    let $$S = \{\{a, b\}, \{d\}, \{b, c\} \}$$, then

    $$$ \begin {align}
    \bigcup S &= \bigcup \{\{a, b\}, \{d\}, \{b, c\}\}\\
                 &= \{a, b\} ∪ \{d\} ∪ \{b, c\} \\
                 &= \{a, b, c, d\}
    \end {align}
    $$$

    So, infinitary union takes a set and applies a union operation $$∪$$ between all its elements. Note, set elements must be
    set themselves, because union can be applied only between sets.
</p>

<p>
    We know that recursive case of $$δ^*$$ returns a union of multiple sets. Each set is an output of transition function
    $$δ(p, a)$$, where $$a$$ is the last symbol of a string $$ya$$, and $$p$$ is a member of set of states which extended transition
    function $$δ^*(q, y)$$ returns, given a state $$q$$ and original string $$ya$$ without last character $$a$$. Yes, I know, it is
    too confusing. The best way too understand how $$δ^*$$ function works is by using a specific example.
</p>
<p>
    {{ LINK_IMG104 }} shows how NFA from {{ LINK_IMG103 }} accepts string <code class="d-code">aaaab</code>. We will do the same thing
    using $$δ^*$$ function. Meaning, we will trace $$δ^*$$ with start state $$q_0$$ and a string <code class="d-code">aaaab</code>
    as input. Thus,

    $$$ \begin{align}
    δ^*(q_0, aaaab) &= \bigcup \{δ(p,b) \mid p ∈ δ^∗(q_0, aaaa)\} \\
    δ^*(q_0, aaaa) &= \bigcup \{δ(p,a) \mid p ∈ δ^∗(q_0, aaa)\} \\
    δ^*(q_0, aaa) &= \bigcup \{δ(p,a) \mid p ∈ δ^∗(q_0, aa)\} \\
    δ^*(q_0, aa) &= \bigcup \{δ(p,a) \mid p ∈ δ^∗(q_0, a)\} \\
    δ^*(q_0, a) &= \bigcup \{δ(p,a) \mid p ∈ δ^∗(q_0, ε)\} \\
    δ^*(q_0, ε) &= \{q_0\}
    \end {align}
    $$$

    Notice, how recursively applying definition of $$δ^∗$$ we end up at the base case. But we are not done yet, by
    recursive substitution,

    $$$ \begin{align}
    δ^*(q_0, a) &= \bigcup \{δ(p,a) \mid p ∈ \{q_0\}\} \\
                &= δ(q_0, a) \\
                &= \{q_1, q_2\} \\\\

    δ^*(q_0, aa) &= \bigcup \{δ(p,a) \mid p ∈ \{q_1, q_2\}\} \\
    &= δ(q_1,a) ∪ δ(q_2,a) \\
    &= \{q_0\} ∪ \{q_3\} \\
    &= \{q_0, q_3\} \\\\

    δ^*(q_0, aaa) &= \bigcup \{δ(p,a) \mid p ∈ \{q_0, q_3\}\} \\
    &= δ(q_0,a) ∪ δ(q_3,a) \\
    &= \{q_1, q_2\} ∪ \{∅\} \\
    &= \{q_1, q_2\} \\\\

    δ^*(q_0, aaaa) &= \bigcup \{δ(p,a) \mid p ∈ \{q_1, q_2\}\} \\
    &= δ(q_1,a) ∪ δ(q_2,a) \\
    &= \{q_0\} ∪ \{q_3\} \\
    &= \{q_0, q_3\} \\\\

    δ^*(q_0, aaaab) &= \bigcup \{δ(p,b) \mid \{q_0, q_3\} \} \\
                &= δ(q_0,b) ∪ δ(q_3,b) \\
                &= \{q_4\} ∪ \{q_0\} \\
                &= \{q_4, q_0\}

    \end {align}
    $$$

    Notice, corresponding between set of resulting states after each substitution in $$δ^*$$ and each level of leaves in
    {{ LINK_IMG104 }}.
</p>

<p>
Equipped with power knowledge of extended transition function we can precisely define what means for NFA to <strong>accept</strong>
a string.

{% for def in site.definitions %}
    {% if def.identity == page.definitions[2] %}
        <a name="{{ def.identity }}"></a>
        <div class="env-header">

        <div class="definition alert">
            {{ def.content }}
        </div>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

<p>
    This is just a fancy way of saying: <i>If an output of $$δ^*$$ has at least one accept state, then NFA accepts a string</i>.

</p>

<h2><a name="{{ page.headers[4].id }}"></a>{{ page.headers[4].name }}</h2>

<p> There are two fundamental ways of implementing NFA:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Converting NFA to DFA and implementing the latter.</li>
    <li>Implementing NFA directly.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    DFA computes in the linear, while NFA in exponential time, thus first option would result in much faster algorithm.
    Unfortunately, we don't know how to convert NFA to DFA yet, therefore we will leave it for the next time.
    For the second option we have two choices:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>We can use backtracking, where given a choice we would recursively cycle through each of them.</li>
    <li>We can keep track of the states that NFA could be in any given moment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Second approach is more intuitive than the first one. Also, it conforms with {{ LINK_DEF107 }}. But
before we start, it would be good to check <a href="{{ POST101.url }}">{{ POST101.title }}</a>, because implementation
    of NFA will be very similar. For guinea pig, we will use NFA from {{ LINK_IMG103 }}. Its formal definition is
</p>
<p>
    $$M = (Q, Σ, δ, q_0, F )$$, where
</p>

<ol>
    <li>$$Q = \{q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4\}$$,</li>
    <li>$$Σ = \{$$<code class="d-code">a</code>$$,$$<code class="d-code">b</code>$$\}$$
    </li>
    <li>$$q_0 = q_0$$,</li>
    <li>$$F = \{q_4\}$$.</li>
    <li>$$δ$$ is described as a <strong>transition table</strong></li>

    will hold current state's next set of states for every input symbol. In <code class="d-code">static {...}</code> block
    we initialise those variables. Think of it as a transition table. In fact, there is a direct correspondence between
    <code class="d-code">static {...}</code> block and {{ LINK_TB101 }}. And lastly,
    <code class="d-code">Set&lt;States&gt; transition(char ch) {...}</code> method returns next set of states.
</p>
<p>
    At this stage, in the DFA implementation we faced a problem: <i>What to do with all the symbols not in the alphabet?</i>
    There were few choices:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Throw an exception.</li>
    <li>Encapsulate alphabet.</li>
    <li>Change DFA itself by introducing a dead state.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    That was for DFA. On the other hand, NFA doesn't have this problem. Because if a state doesn't have a transition for a given
    symbol, then it returns an empty set, which is already in the codomain of $$δ$$ function.
    <i>But what about a case when NFA had to split itself?</i> In that case, all
    current states would return an empty set, from which is impossible to reach accepting state, thus any string with
    symbol not in the alphabet is rejected automatically. The only thing we need to do, is to make sure that by
    default <code class="d-code">Set&lt;States&gt; transition(char ch) {...}</code> returns an empty set.
</p>

<h2><a name="{{ page.headers[6].id }}"></a>{{ page.headers[6].name }}</h2>

<p>
    As I said before, we will implement extended transition function by tracking all the current states.
    To do this we have a few options. For example, we could use a tree where each node would
    represent a state, while edges - transitions. A start state would be a root node, while current states -
    all the leafs in the tree. For example, {{ LINK_IMG104 }} shows a tree for <code class="d-code">aaaab</code> string.
    This approach would enable use to keep track not just current states, but all the previous states as well.
    Another way to implement transition function is by using sets.

{% for code in site.data.source_code %}
    {% if code.id == page.code[1] %}
        <a name="{{ code.id }}"></a>
        <div class="env-header">
            Source code {{ code.id | remove: "SC"  | split: "" | join: "." }}
        </div>
    {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

{% highlight java linenos %}
public class NFA {

  private enum States {
  //...
  }

  // Accepts or rejects a string
  public boolean accept(String string) {
    Set<States> currStates = new HashSet<>();
    currStates.add(States.Q0);

    for (int i = 0; i < string.length(); i++)
      currStates = union(currStates, string.charAt(i));

    return currStates.stream().anyMatch(s -> s.accept);
  }

  // Helper method which returns set of next states
  private Set<States> union(Set<States> currStates, char ch) {
    Set<States> nextStates = new HashSet<>();

    for (States cState: currStates)
       nextStates.addAll(cState.transition(ch));

    return nextStates;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
So we have two methods:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <code class="d-code">public boolean accept(String string) {...}</code>.
    Which is very similar to DFA's. Both have same signature as well as functionality. In the first few lines we
    create set of current states. Initially it has only a start state <code class="d-code">States.Q0</code>. Then, by
    looping through each character in the string, we reassign set of current states to the union of next states, which
    becomes current states. It is like in the {{ LINK_DEF107 }} of transition function, except we use loop for iteration, instead of recursive calls.
    The last line corresponds to the {{ LINK_DEF108 }} which checks if there is an accept state in the last set of states.
    </li>
    <li>
        <code class="d-code">private Set&lt;States&gt; union(Set&lt;States&gt; currStates, char ch) {...}</code>.
        It is a helper method which given a set of current states and a symbol returns the union of all the next states.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="{{ page.headers[7].id }}"></a>{{ page.headers[7].name }}</h2>

<p>
    As I sad before, NFA computes in exponential time, while DFA in linear. Thus, I can't imagine any practical situation
    where above NFA implementation would be more useful rather equivalent DFA.
    However, my goal at the moment is not to be practical but to learn and have fun.
