<p>
  A <strong>nondeterministic finite automaton (ε-NFA)</strong> $$M$$ is a 5-tuple $$(Q, Σ, δ, q_0, F)$$, where
</p>

<ol>
  <li>$$Q$$ is a finite set called the <strong>states</strong>,
  <li>$$Σ$$ is a finite set called the <strong>alphabet</strong>,
  <li>$$δ : Q × Σ_ε → P(Q)$$ is the <strong>transition function</strong> and $$Σ_ε = Σ ∪ \{ε\}$$
  <li>$$q_0 ∈ Q$$ is the <strong>start state</strong>, and
  <li>$$F ⊆ Q$$ is the set of <strong>accept states</strong>.
</ol>
