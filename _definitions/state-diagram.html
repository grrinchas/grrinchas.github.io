<p>
    A <strong>state diagram</strong> for DFA $$M = (Q, Σ, δ, q_0, F)$$ is graph defined as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>For each state $$q$$ in $$Q$$ there is a node.</li>
    <li>For each state $$q$$ in $$Q$$ and each input symbol $$a$$ in Σ, let $$δ(q,a) = p$$.
        Then the state diagram has an arc (arrow) from node $$q$$ to node $$p$$, labeled $$a$$.
        If there are several input symbols that cause transitions from $$q$$ to $$p$$, then the state diagram can have
        one arc,
        labeled by the list of these symbols.
    </li>
    <li>There is an arrow into the start state $$q_0$$ which does not originate at any node.</li>
    <li>Nodes corresponding to accepting states (those in $$F$$) are marked by double circle. States not in $$F$$ have a
        single circle.
    </li>
</ul>
