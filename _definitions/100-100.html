<p>
  A <strong>deterministic finite automaton (DFA)</strong> $$M$$ is a 5-tuple $$(Q, Σ, δ, q_0, F )$$, where
</p>

<ol>
  <li>$$Q$$ is a finite set called the <strong>states</strong>,
  <li>$$Σ$$ is a finite set called the <strong>alphabet</strong>,
  <li>$$δ : Q × Σ → Q$$ is the <strong>transition function</strong>,
  <li>$$q_0 ∈ Q$$ is the <strong>start state</strong>, and
  <li>$$F ⊆ Q$$ is the set of <strong>accept states</strong>.
</ol>
