<p>
    From last post <a href="{{ POST103.url }}">{{ POST103.title }}</a> we saw some nice properties of the ε-NFA.
    Mainly involving their design simplicity. Unfortunately, ε-NFA can be much more slower
    compared to the equivalent DFA. In this post we will discuss few different ways of converting ε-NFA to DFA. In
    other words, we will remove nondeterminism from ε-NFA.
